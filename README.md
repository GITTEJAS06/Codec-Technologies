# Task 1

# 👩‍💼 Employee Performance Analytics Dashboard 📊

This project provides a **data-driven approach** to evaluate and monitor employee performance using **Excel (dataset)** and **Power BI (dashboard)**.  
It helps HR teams, managers, and decision-makers to track productivity, identify top performers, and improve workforce efficiency.


## 📂 Project Files

- 📊 **Employee_Performance.xlsx** → Raw dataset containing employee details, performance scores, and KPIs  
- 📈 **Employee Performance Analytics.pbix** → Interactive Power BI dashboard built on top of the dataset  


## 🚀 Key Insights

✅ **Performance Overview** — Compare employees based on KPIs like sales, tasks completed, targets achieved  
✅ **Department-wise Analysis** — Evaluate performance across departments (HR, Sales, IT, etc.)  
✅ **Top Performers** — Identify high achievers and reward them 🏆  
✅ **Improvement Areas** — Highlight employees falling behind targets 
✅ **Interactive Filters** — Filter by department, role, or time period  


## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- 🟢 **Microsoft Excel** → Data storage & preprocessing  
- 🟡 **Power BI** → Dashboard creation, DAX measures, KPIs, and visualizations  


## 📊 Dashboard Features

- 📌 KPI Cards → Average Performance, Total Employees, Target Achievement %  
- 📈 Line/Bar Charts → Trends of performance over time  
- 🗂️ Slicers → Department, Role, and Time filters  
- 🌍 Drill-down Visuals → From organization-level to individual-level performance  

## 🚀 How to Use

1️⃣ Open the dataset:  
   - `Employee_Performance.xlsx` for raw data  

2️⃣ Open the dashboard:  
   - `Employee Performance Analytics.pbix` in **Power BI Desktop**
